# YNAB MCP: Remaining Steps

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

1. **Docker Container Setup**
   - Update Dockerfile to properly include MCP SDK dependencies
   - Ensure proper volume mounting for token persistence
   - Create a docker-compose file for easier deployment

2. **End-to-End Testing with Claude**
   - Connect to Claude using the wrapper script
   - Test the full authentication flow
   - Verify all YNAB operations work correctly

3. **Wrapper Script Updates**
   - Modify the wrapper script to correctly launch the new implementation
   - Ensure proper environment variable passing
   - Add logging for easier debugging

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Implement comprehensive error logging
   - Add health check endpoint
   - Document deployment process

## Resumption Prompt

```
Let's finalize the YNAB MCP implementation by completing these key tasks:

1. Update the Dockerfile to properly package our MCP SDK implementation:
   - Ensure all dependencies are included
   - Set up proper volume mounting for token persistence
   - Configure environment variables

2. Create or update the wrapper script that connects Claude to our YNAB MCP server:
   - Use the appropriate protocol format
   - Handle stdin/stdout properly
   - Pass through any required environment variables

3. Set up a docker-compose.yml file for easy deployment:
   - Define the YNAB MCP service
   - Configure volumes and networks
   - Set environment variables

4. Perform end-to-end testing with the Docker container:
   - Build and run the container
   - Test connecting Claude to the container
   - Verify authentication flow works
   - Confirm YNAB operations function correctly

Once these tasks are complete, we'll have a fully functional YNAB MCP implementation that works seamlessly with Claude!
