# YNAB MCP Implementation Summary

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented and tested the YNAB MCP server with the following accomplishments:

1. **Built and Configured Docker Container**
   - Successfully built the Docker image: `ynab-mcp:latest`
   - Configured volumes for persistent storage
   - Set up proper environment variables

2. **Emma Integration**
   - Configured direct Docker integration without wrapper script
   - Added to Emma's MCP configuration via `emma mcp add-json`
   - Successfully tested communication between Emma and the MCP server

3. **Authentication Testing**
   - Verified proper authentication flow initiation
   - Confirmed OAuth URL generation works correctly
   - Ready for complete authentication with authorization code

4. **Next Steps**
   - Complete the OAuth flow with an actual authorization code
   - Test all YNAB tools with authenticated account
   - Create PR from feature branch
   - Update tech design documentation

## Configuration Details

The YNAB MCP is configured with the following Docker command:

```json
{
  "command": "docker",
  "args": [
    "run",
    "--rm",
    "-i",
    "-v",
    "/home/claude-user/.mcp/ynab-mcp:/app/data",
    "-v",
    "/home/claude-user/ynab-mcp/config:/app/config",
    "-e",
    "NODE_ENV=production",
    "ynab-mcp:latest"
  ]
}
```

This matches the pattern used by other successful MCP implementations like Google Workspace MCP.

## Testing Results

- **Basic Tool Access**: Successfully verified Emma can access YNAB tools
- **Authentication Initiation**: Successfully initiated authentication flow
- **OAuth URL Generation**: Successfully generated proper OAuth URL

## Outstanding Tasks

1. Complete the authentication flow with user-provided authorization code
2. Test all YNAB API endpoints with authenticated account
3. Create pull request from feature branch
4. Update technical design documentation in `/home/claude-user/mattweg/designs/ynab-mcp-integration/`
5. Deploy to production for regular use
