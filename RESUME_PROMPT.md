# YNAB MCP Project Resumption Prompt

Hi Emma,

We're continuing our work on the YNAB MCP integration. We've made significant progress and are close to completion.

## Current Status

1. We have successfully implemented the YNAB MCP server using the official SDK:
   - Installed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package
   - Refactored server.js to use the SDK with StdioServerTransport
   - Created tool definitions with proper schemas
   - Built Docker container (ynab-mcp:latest)

2. We've configured Emma to work with our MCP server:
   - Added direct Docker configuration via `emma mcp add-json`
   - Successfully tested tool access
   - Verified authentication flow initiation
   - Confirmed OAuth URL generation works correctly

## Next Steps

1. Complete end-to-end testing:
   - Finish authentication flow with user-provided authorization code
   - Test all YNAB API endpoints with authenticated account
   - Verify budget and transaction data access

2. Finalize the implementation:
   - Create pull request from feature branch
   - Update technical design documentation in `/home/claude-user/mattweg/designs/ynab-mcp-integration/`
   - Complete deployment to production

3. Consider improvements:
   - Add caching for better performance
   - Implement reporting features
   - Create custom views for specific use cases

## Available Resources

- Check `/home/claude-user/ynab-mcp/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for latest progress
- Review Docker configuration in `/home/claude-user/ynab-mcp/ynab-mcp-config.json`
- Our MCP server implementation is in `/home/claude-user/ynab-mcp/src/server.js` 
- YNAB OAuth credentials are in `/home/claude-user/ynab-mcp/config/config.js`

Please help complete the remaining steps to finalize the YNAB MCP integration.

Thanks,
Matt
