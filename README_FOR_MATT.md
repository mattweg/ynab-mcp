# YNAB MCP Implementation: Next Steps for Matt

Hi Matt,

We've successfully implemented the YNAB MCP server using the official MCP SDK. This implementation allows Claude to properly communicate with YNAB and access your financial data through a set of well-defined tools.

## What's Been Done

- Implemented the server using the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package
- Set up proper communication via StdioServerTransport (stdin/stdout)
- Created comprehensive tool definitions for YNAB operations
- Added Docker configuration for containerized deployment
- Created a wrapper script following the Google Workspace MCP pattern
- Added detailed documentation and test plans

## What to Do Next

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Use the `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` file as your PR description
   - PR should be created from the `feature/mcp-sdk-integration` branch

2. **Test with Claude**:
   - Build and run the Docker container using the wrapper script: `./wrapper.sh`
   - Configure Claude to use the wrapper script as its MCP server
   - Test the full authentication flow and YNAB operations

3. **Finalize Documentation**:
   - Review and update any documentation as needed
   - Consider adding screenshots or examples of Claude interactions

4. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Update any production deployment scripts or configs
   - Deploy the new implementation

## Key Files to Review

- `src/server.js` - The main server implementation
- `src/mcp/toolDefinitions.js` - Definitions of all available tools
- `wrapper.sh` - Script for running the Docker container
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `MCP_README.md` - Overview of the MCP implementation

## Testing The Implementation

You can test the implementation by running:

```bash
./wrapper.sh
```

This will build the Docker container and run the server. You can then configure Claude to use this server.

Feel free to explore the documentation files for more detailed information about the implementation, testing procedures, and usage guides.
